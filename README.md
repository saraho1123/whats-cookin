## Project Overview
This project we created a recipe tracking/meal planning application. Our app's functionality included a user being able to: choosing and view their favorite recipes, choosing and viewing recipes to cook, filtering recipes by type, ingredients favorites and recipes to cook, as well as plan what items the user would need to buy (based on what ingredients the recipe calls for and what the user 'has' in their pantry).



## Goals
Our personal goals were to get better at sad path TDD, get a lot more comfortable with the array prototypes, and integrate what weâ€™ve learned about JS so far. This was one of our first projects using TDD and ES6 JavaScript. We also wanted to work together in such a way that we would be willing to work together again!

## Technologies
JavaScript (ES6)
HTML
CSS
dev tools
Adobe????

## Challenges
Our first big challenge was deciding how many Classes to include. We started with three, increased to six and ended up with five. After getting into our project, we realized that having a way to 'clean up' and organize our data would have been helpful. Although we didn't get to it for this project, it was a big learning opportunity for the future! One thing we wish we had more time for was more TDD. Although we included it, we did not test for edge cases or for 'breaking' our code.

## Wins
We overcame some personal things while tackling this project. Although it definitely slowed us down, we are very proud of the work we were able to accomplish! 

We also made our app responsive, which was a fun win!
